{
  "holding": [
    "In open thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer, the surgeon’s hand firmly holds a surgical instrument (such as a hemostat, forceps, electrocautery, or an aspirator) or maintains control of gauze, keeping the tool ready and stable without releasing. The action is steady and sustained, used to maintain exposure, keep tissue in a fixed position, or prepare for the next maneuver.",
    "The surgeon continuously holds an instrument in the operative field of open thyroidectomy, keeping the tool aligned with the target region while other actions occur nearby. The hand maintains a stable grip on the instrument handle, preventing drift and ensuring immediate readiness for dissection or hemostasis.",
    "A hand or instrument maintains a stable hold over tissue, wound edges, or surgical materials during thyroidectomy, keeping the target from moving. The scene shows sustained control without the clamping force of hemostasis or the motion of cutting."
  ],
  "tensioning": [
    "During open thyroidectomy, tensioning refers to applying controlled pulling force on tissue, skin flap, strap muscles, or the thyroid lobe to create a clear dissection plane. By increasing tissue tautness, the surgeon improves visibility and enables safe separation, especially near vessels, the parathyroid glands, or the recurrent laryngeal nerve.",
    "An instrument or hand applies traction to maintain tension in the surgical field, pulling tissue in a consistent direction to expose deeper anatomy. The action emphasizes sustained stretching rather than repositioning or grasping alone.",
    "Tissue is stretched and held under tension to reveal anatomical boundaries; the target changes shape and becomes taut, creating a safe plane for dissection and reducing accidental injury to critical structures."
  ],
  "aspirating": [
    "In the thyroid surgical field, aspirating describes using a suction tip to remove blood, smoke from electrocautery, irrigation fluid, or debris, restoring a clear view of the wound and key structures. The suction instrument stays near pooled fluid regions and repeatedly clears occlusion, often coordinated with cauterizing or cutting.",
    "A suction device actively removes fluid and smoke near the operative site in open thyroidectomy, tracking along areas with accumulated blood or irrigation fluid. The instrument tip is directed toward occluded regions to regain visibility.",
    "Fluid, smoke, or debris is removed from within or around the wound cavity, reducing visual obstruction and revealing tissue surfaces and landmarks. The field becomes clearer after the suction action."
  ],
  "releasing": [
    "Releasing in open thyroidectomy means loosening a previously maintained grasp, clamp, or retraction—such as letting go of tissue with forceps, relaxing tension from a retractor, or opening a hemostat after temporary control. It marks a transition: after positioning or hemostasis, the hand relaxes and the object returns toward a neutral state.",
    "A hand opens or loosens an instrument grip in thyroidectomy, ending a prior holding or clamping action. The tool or tissue is no longer constrained by the previous grasp.",
    "The target tissue or object is freed from constraint and moves back slightly; the interaction ends without continuing pressure, traction, or cutting."
  ],
  "passing_to": [
    "Passing_to describes transferring a surgical instrument, gauze, needle holder, or another tool from one hand to another person’s hand during open thyroidectomy. The key semantics is an intentional handover: one hand presents the tool, the other receives it, and control changes ownership, often during workflow transitions such as switching from dissection to suturing.",
    "One hand extends an instrument toward another hand in the thyroid surgical field, and the receiving hand takes the instrument. The action is defined by transfer of control rather than using the tool on tissue.",
    "A tool changes possession between two hands (surgeon and assistant), often occurring near the surgical field boundary. The interaction emphasizes handover and coordination rather than tissue manipulation."
  ],
  "stabilizing": [
    "Stabilizing refers to keeping tissue, the thyroid lobe, wound edge, or a tool steady to prevent unwanted motion during delicate maneuvers near vessels or the recurrent laryngeal nerve. A hand or instrument applies gentle counterforce to reduce drift, enabling precise cutting, cauterizing, or ligation.",
    "An instrument or hand provides counter-support to reduce motion of the target region in thyroidectomy. The target remains relatively fixed while other tools operate nearby.",
    "The stabilized tissue shows minimal movement; the interaction is defined by steady support rather than pulling (retraction) or pressing (compression)."
  ],
  "retracting": [
    "In open thyroidectomy, retracting is pulling back skin flaps, strap muscles, wound edges, or thyroid tissue using a retractor or hand to maintain exposure of the operative field. Retraction creates and preserves an open workspace to reveal vessels, parathyroid glands, and the trachea region.",
    "A retractor or hand continuously pulls tissue away from the center of operation in thyroidectomy, holding the displaced boundary to maintain visibility and access.",
    "Tissue boundaries are displaced and kept away from the active dissection area, enlarging the operative window; the cue is sustained pulling that maintains exposure."
  ],
  "positioning": [
    "Positioning means deliberately moving an instrument, gauze, retractor, or tissue segment to a desired location or orientation in the thyroid surgical field. It often precedes cutting or cauterizing, ensuring the tool tip aligns with the target anatomy.",
    "The surgeon adjusts the placement and orientation of an instrument in open thyroidectomy so the tip aligns with a precise target region, without yet applying cutting, cautery, or clamping.",
    "A tool or tissue is moved into a planned pose and then held briefly; the action emphasizes alignment and placement rather than sustained traction or pressure."
  ],
  "lifting": [
    "Lifting describes elevating tissue (thyroid lobe, flap, strap muscle edge) or a tool upward away from the wound bed to improve access and visibility. The lifted object increases separation from surrounding structures, creating space for safe dissection.",
    "A hand or instrument raises tissue in thyroidectomy, increasing vertical distance from the surgical bed and revealing the underlying plane for dissection or vessel control.",
    "The target is elevated, opening space beneath it; the cue is upward displacement that improves access rather than sideways pulling (retraction)."
  ],
  "grasping": [
    "Grasping in thyroidectomy refers to firmly pinching and holding tissue or an object with forceps, hemostat, or hand—typically stronger and more localized than holding. It secures a specific point for traction, dissection, or removal.",
    "Forceps or a hemostat tightly grips a focal point of tissue or a material in the thyroid surgical field, enabling controlled movement or stabilization of that point.",
    "A localized region is pinched and constrained; the interaction is defined by a tight pinch at the tips rather than broad support or sustained compression."
  ],
  "clamping": [
    "Clamping describes using a hemostat or clamp to close and compress a vessel, tissue pedicle, or bleeding source during thyroidectomy. It is often followed by ligation or cauterization. The clamped region remains fixed until the next hemostatic step.",
    "A hemostat clamps down on a vessel or tissue bundle in open thyroid surgery, restricting flow or motion. The tool jaws remain closed to maintain hemostasis.",
    "A vessel or pedicle is occluded by a clamp, indicating temporary control of bleeding. The cue is the closed clamp maintaining pressure at a point."
  ],
  "compressing": [
    "Compressing refers to applying pressure with gauze, an instrument, or fingers to reduce bleeding, flatten tissue, or maintain a clean operative field in thyroid surgery. It is sustained downward force without cutting or clamping.",
    "Gauze or an instrument presses down on the wound surface or tissue in open thyroidectomy to control oozing and stabilize the area for visualization.",
    "The target surface is pressed and flattened; the interaction is defined by continuous pressure rather than pinching (grasping) or closing jaws (clamping)."
  ],
  "incising": [
    "Incising is making an initial controlled cut on skin, fascia, or superficial tissue layers to open access in open thyroidectomy. The action forms a new opening and clear wound edges, often performed with a scalpel or electrocautery at the beginning of exposure.",
    "A cutting tool creates a deliberate incision line in the neck surgical field, forming an opening that exposes deeper layers. The motion is controlled along a planned path.",
    "A new wound opening is created and deepened; the cue is the formation of a cut boundary rather than bulk removal or dissection of planes."
  ],
  "cutting": [
    "Cutting describes separating tissue planes or dividing connective tissue using scissors, a scalpel, or electrocautery during thyroid cancer surgery. It occurs in flap dissection, thyroid mobilization, lymph node dissection, and trimming during closure. The cue is a tool edge progressing along a boundary or repeated scissor closure.",
    "A tool actively slices or snips tissue in thyroidectomy, with visible progression along a target region. The action emphasizes separation by a cutting edge or scissor motion.",
    "Tissue is divided into separate parts; the interaction shows a clear cutting event rather than slow teasing apart of planes (dissection)."
  ],
  "dissecting": [
    "Dissecting in thyroidectomy is careful separation of tissue planes to mobilize the thyroid lobe, isolate vessels, and expose the recurrent laryngeal nerve or parathyroid glands. It is more semantic than cutting: it involves following anatomical planes, gentle separation, and minimizing collateral damage.",
    "An instrument performs careful plane-by-plane separation in open thyroid surgery, often with small controlled movements to isolate structures without abrupt cutting.",
    "Layers are gradually separated to reveal anatomy; the cue is progressive exposure of planes and structures rather than a single decisive cut."
  ],
  "cauterizing": [
    "Cauterizing refers to using electrocautery to coagulate small vessels, stop bleeding, or dissect with simultaneous hemostasis during thyroidectomy. It may generate smoke and is often coordinated with suction. The semantics includes energy application to tissue contact with hemostatic effect.",
    "An electrocautery instrument contacts tissue in the thyroid surgical field to coagulate bleeding points or cut with hemostasis. The action often coincides with smoke and suction nearby.",
    "Bleeding is controlled by thermal coagulation at a contact point; the cue is localized energy-based hemostasis rather than mechanical clamping."
  ],
  "wiping": [
    "Wiping describes using gauze or sponge to wipe away blood or fluid from the wound surface, restoring visibility and drying the field during thyroid surgery. Unlike suction, wiping is contact-based cleaning with a swabbing motion over tissue or instrument surfaces.",
    "Gauze swabs across the surgical site in open thyroidectomy, removing blood residue and revealing tissue surfaces. The motion is sweeping and contact-based.",
    "The operative surface is cleaned by direct contact; the cue is a repeated swabbing motion rather than fluid removal through suction."
  ],
  "irrigating": [
    "Irrigating refers to flushing the operative field with sterile fluid during thyroidectomy to clear debris, dilute blood, and assess bleeding points. It is commonly followed by suction or wiping to remove fluid. The semantics is introducing fluid into the wound for cleaning and verification of hemostasis.",
    "A fluid stream is introduced into the thyroid surgical field to wash tissue surfaces and expose bleeding points; the action typically precedes suction to clear the fluid.",
    "The wound cavity is filled or wetted by irrigation fluid; the cue is the addition of fluid rather than its removal."
  ],
  "suturing": [
    "Suturing is stitching tissue layers or skin during closure in open thyroidectomy using a needle holder and suture thread. The action includes needle insertion, pulling thread through, and repeated stitch cycles, aiming to approximate tissues and close the wound.",
    "A needle holder drives a suture needle through tissue in the thyroid surgical field, and the suture thread is pulled to form stitches during wound closure.",
    "Tissue edges are approximated by stitches; the cue is repeated needle passage and thread tensioning rather than clamping or cutting."
  ],
  "tying": [
    "Tying refers to knotting suture material or ligating a vessel during thyroidectomy, often following clamping or suturing. The action forms loops and tightens them to secure hemostasis or tissue approximation.",
    "Hands or instruments manipulate suture thread in thyroid surgery to form and tighten knots, securing a stitch or ligature around a target structure.",
    "A knot is formed and tightened; the cue is loop formation and tightening rather than needle penetration (suturing)."
  ],
  "closing": [
    "Closing describes the overall process of bringing wound edges together at the end of thyroidectomy, including tissue approximation, suturing, and final skin closure. It emphasizes the final convergence and sealing of the surgical opening rather than a single stitch.",
    "The wound edges in open thyroid surgery are approximated and secured as part of closure, with sutures placed and tightened to achieve a sealed incision.",
    "The surgical opening reduces and becomes sealed; the cue is the wound edges coming together as the final stage of the procedure."
  ],
  "inserting": [
    "Inserting refers to placing an instrument tip, gauze, drain, or needle into the wound or between tissue layers during thyroidectomy. Examples include inserting a drainage tube, placing gauze into a cavity, or inserting a needle for suturing. The key cue is forward motion into an opening or space.",
    "A tool or material is advanced into the operative cavity in thyroid surgery, entering the wound space intentionally for a surgical purpose.",
    "An object moves from outside into an internal wound region; the cue is containment after insertion rather than mere contact."
  ],
  "removing": [
    "Removing describes extracting tissue (such as thyroid specimen), gauze, drain, or an instrument from the surgical field after completing a step. The key semantics is the object leaving the operative area rather than being repositioned within it.",
    "An instrument or material is pulled out from the thyroid surgical field, leaving the wound area and no longer interacting with tissue.",
    "The object exits the operative region; the cue is departure from the field rather than transfer between hands."
  ],
  "placing": [
    "Placing means putting gauze, a retractor, an instrument, a clip, or a drain onto a specific location in the thyroid operative field and leaving it there for a purpose such as hemostasis, protection, exposure, or drainage. It emphasizes the final settled state.",
    "A surgeon positions an object at a specific site in thyroidectomy and releases it to remain in place, such as placing gauze over a bleeding point or placing a retractor for sustained exposure.",
    "An object is set down and stays at a location; the cue is a stable final placement rather than continuous adjustment (positioning)."
  ],
  "applying": [
    "Applying refers to putting a material or substance onto tissue during thyroidectomy, such as applying pressure with gauze, applying hemostatic agents, adhesive, or sterile patches. The semantic focus is deposition or contact meant to produce an effect (hemostasis, protection, sealing).",
    "A material is applied onto a tissue surface in open thyroid surgery to achieve a functional effect, for example applying gauze pressure or applying a hemostatic patch.",
    "The target surface receives a material or pressure intended to change the condition of the site; the cue is effect-oriented contact rather than mere placement."
  ],
  "covering": [
    "Covering describes using gauze, sterile patches, or tissue flaps to cover a wound area or protect underlying structures during thyroidectomy. It can shield tissue from heat, maintain moisture, or keep the field clean. The cue is an overlay that hides or partially occludes the target area.",
    "Gauze or a patch is laid over the surgical site in open thyroid surgery, forming a protective layer that covers tissue surfaces or wound edges.",
    "The covered region becomes partially hidden beneath a layer; the cue is an overlay rather than a pressing motion."
  ],
  "touching": [
    "Touching refers to light contact between an instrument or hand and tissue without strong manipulation—often for probing, checking tension, locating anatomy, or gentle exploration during thyroidectomy. It is distinct from grasping or compressing because it lacks firm force and does not maintain a tight hold.",
    "An instrument tip lightly contacts tissue in the thyroid surgical field to probe or indicate a region, without pinching, pulling, or cutting.",
    "The contact is brief and gentle; the cue is minimal deformation and absence of sustained force or displacement."
  ],
  "occluding": [
    "Occluding describes blocking a vessel, an opening, or the line of sight using an instrument, gauze, or tissue during thyroidectomy. It may be intentional for bleeding control (temporary vessel occlusion) or unintended when a hand or tool blocks visibility. The core semantics is obstruction that prevents flow or view.",
    "An object in open thyroid surgery blocks a vessel or the camera view, creating an obstruction. The occluding item prevents visibility or restricts flow at a point.",
    "The target becomes hidden or blocked; the cue is obstruction rather than active cutting or grasping."
  ],
  "inside": [
    "Inside describes a spatial relation in the surgical scene: an instrument tip, gauze, drain, or tissue is located inside the wound cavity, under a tissue flap, or within the operative space during open thyroidectomy. It emphasizes containment within a region rather than an active manipulation.",
    "A tool or material is situated within the operative wound space in thyroid surgery, with its tip or body contained inside the incision or tissue cavity.",
    "The object is contained within the wound region; the cue is spatial containment rather than contact on the surface."
